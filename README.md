Overview
Hate speech on social media has become a growing concern, leading to toxic online environments and real-world harm. This project aims to combat this issue by developing an efficient and reliable hate speech detection system . The system leverages state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT alongside traditional machine learning algorithms to detect both explicit and subtle forms of hate speech.

The project is designed to be scalable, adaptable, and easy to use, with a user-friendly Streamlit app for real-time predictions. Whether you're a moderator, researcher, or developer, this tool can help identify toxic content and create safer online communities.

Features
State-of-the-Art Models : Combines BERT with traditional machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) for robust performance.
Ensemble Learning : Uses a Voting Classifier to combine predictions from multiple models, improving accuracy and reducing false positives/negatives.
Real-Time Detection : Integrated with a Streamlit app for instant hate speech classification.
Visualization Tools : Provides graphical insights such as accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and word clouds.
Scalability : Designed to adapt to evolving hate speech trends through continuous updates and retraining.
Multi-Language Potential : Future-ready for expanding language support beyond English.
Methodology
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Text Cleaning : Removes URLs, special characters, numbers, and punctuation.
Tokenization : Splits text into words using NLTK's word_tokenize.
Stopword Removal : Eliminates common words like "the" and "is" to reduce noise.
Lemmatization : Reduces words to their base form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").
2. Feature Engineering
TF-IDF Vectorization : Converts text into numerical features for traditional models.
BERT Tokenization : Prepares input for BERT using BertTokenizer.
3. Model Selection and Training
Trains and evaluates multiple models:
Traditional Models : Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.
Transformer Model : BERT.
Ensemble Model : Combines Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
4. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC.
5. Deployment
Models are saved using torch.save() (for BERT) and pickle (for traditional models).
Integrated with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
